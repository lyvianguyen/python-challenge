# Python Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll

This assignmnet consists of two tasks: PyBank and PyPoll. In both challenges, you will apply your Python scripting skills to real-world situations involving financial analysis and election data. 

## Getting Started
1. Create a New Repository

- Create a new GitHub repository specifically for this project and name it "python-challenge." Do not add this homework assignment to an existing repository.

2. Clone the Repository

- Clone the newly created "python-challenge" repository to your local computer.

3. Organize the Folders

- Inside your local Git repository, create two folders for each Python assignment: "PyBank" and "PyPoll."

Folder Contents

- For each folder you created, add the following content:
  - A new file named main.py. This will serve as the main script to run for each analysis.
  - A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files needed for the analysis. Ensure your script has the correct path to access these CSV files.
  - An "analysis" folder that contains a text file for the results of your analysis.
 
# PyBank Instructions

In the PyBank challenge, you will create a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You'll be provided with a financial dataset named budget_data.csv, which contains two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses."

The task includes calculating the following values:

- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# PyPoll Instructions
In the PyPoll challenge, our task is to assist a small, rural town in modernizing its vote-counting process. We'll be given a set of poll data named election_data.csv, consisting of three columns: "Voter ID," "County," and "Candidate."

The tasks involves calculating the following values:

- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on the popular vote
